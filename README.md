# WGU-Object-Oriented-Application

This application is an example of an inventory management system I made for WGU. This example is using a bicycle shop inventory. The part information includes the part ID, how many you have in the inventory, and the cost per unit for each part. You are able to use parts to create new products (bicycles). Products and parts can be modified to update information on prices and inventory.

I would add to this program the ability to automatically use the items in the inventory when making a product. Right now, when you make a product it won't update the part's inventory count. You have to update it manually.
